## User Directory

An employee directory created with React. The application's UI will be broken into components, will manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Deployed Application
* Live on Heroku
* https://magsmagsmags-react-directory.herokuapp.com/

## Github Repository
* https://github.com/magsmagsmags/user-directory


## User Story
```
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
```

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Application Functionality
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Technologies
 * This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* material-ui table
